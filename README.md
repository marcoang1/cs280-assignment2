## Lexical Analyzer

The analyzer is used to analyze a basic programming language that contains basic mathematical operations along with strings and basic statements. The code must start with a begin token and end with an end token.

## Implementation

The style of implementation for this program was mostly joined with a previous assignment about operation overloading. This assignment works as the second part of a three assignment series of creating a lexical analyzer.
